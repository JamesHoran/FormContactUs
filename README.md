This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Next start the server and the client (front end)

Change directories so you're in the server

```bash
npm run dev
```

next change directories so you're in the client (front end)

```bash
cd client
```

start the front end with

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `client/src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
